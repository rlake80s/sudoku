# sudoku

Generates solvable sudoku puzzles.

Currently just prints the puzzle setup board to the console after creating the board and confirming the setup is solvable.
Might update to something that allows interactive play in the browser in the future, but this as far as I wanted to go.

Became interested in this after working on a [2d maze generator](https://github.com/rlake80s/maze_generator).

Like that project, this is a pretty messy, monolithic vanilla javascript app which I might refactor to use TypeScript or just ES6 modules for better code organization in the future, but for now, this is it.
